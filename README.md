PySimpleSOAP / soap2py
======================

Python simple and lightweight SOAP library for client and server web services interfaces aimed to be as small and easy as possible, supporting the most common functionality.
Initially, it was inspired by [PHP Soap Extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php) (mimicking its functionality, simplicity, and ease of use), with many advanced features added.

**Supports Python 3** (same codebase, no need to run 2to3)

Goals
-----

 * Simple: originally less than 200LOC client/server concrete implementation for easy maintainability and enhancements.
 * Flexible: adapted to several SOAP dialects/servers (Java Axis, .Net, WCF, JBoss, "jetty"), with the possibility of fine-tuning XML request and responses
 * Pythonic: no artifacts, no class generation, no special types, RPC calls parameters and return values are simple python structures (dicts, list, etc.)
 * Dynamic: no definition (WSDL) required, dynamic generation and parsing supported (cached in a pickle file for performance, supporting fixing broken WSDL)
 * Easy: simple XML manipulation, including basic serialization and raw object-like access to SOAP messages
 * Extensible: supports several HTTP wrappers (httplib2, pycurl, urllib2) for special transport needs over SSL and proxy (ISA)
 * WSGI compliant: server dispatcher can be integrated into other python frameworks (web2py, Django, etc.)
 * Backwards compatible: stable API, no breaking changes between releases
 * Lightweight: low memory footprint and fast processing (an order of magnitude in some situations, relative to other implementations)

History
-------

The client initially developed for AFIP (Argentina's IRS) web services: electronic invoice, tax bonus, insurance, foreign trade, agriculture, customs, etc. (http://code.google.com/p/pyafipws/wiki/ProjectSummary)

Now it has been extended to support other web services like Currency Exchange Control and TrazaMed (National Traceability of Medical Drugs Program)

Also, includes Server-side support (a generic dispatcher, in order to be exposed from web2py service framework, adaptable to other web servers, including examples for standalone WSGI and Django)

Source Code originally available on [GoogleCode](https://code.google.com/p/pysimplesoap)

Changelog
---------

Recent changes (2014/2015):

* Plug-in system to support for WSSE (Web-Services Security extensions)
* WSSE UsernameToken, UsernameDigestToken and BinaryTokenSignature support
* Pythonic XML Security Library basic implementation (canonicalization, SHA1 hashing and RSA signing/verification using X509 digital certificates)
* Improved SOAP Fault details
* Several fixes (basic python3 support, CDATA, )
* [Breaking] Fixed bugs that occur when dealing with WSDL's that contain nested complex types.  Such WSDL's are commonly generated by .NET WCF services that have been developed using "contract first" style where developers define classes with a full inheritance hierarchy that are implicitly converted to WCF soap services. See Issue #42 (https://github.com/pysimplesoap/pysimplesoap/issues/42).

Ongoing efforts:

* Unit Tests update & clean up (removing old tests, better framework, fixing non-deterministic results, etc.)
* WSDL advanced support (unifying nested elements structure dialects)
* Python3 support for WSSE XMLSec (M2Crypto alternatives?)
* Source code refactoring to improve readability and maintainability
* Improving interop with .NET WCF services

Previously contributed features (circa 2013, forked and merged back):

* Corrected support for multiple SOAP ports/bindings
* Support for both `import` and `include` stanzas in WSDL
* Support for a WSDL base directory to deal with relative pathnames in import/include stanzas
* Somewhat saner tracing/logging (traces now go to log.debug(), which you can handle per module)
* Somewhat more readable logic (by removing a bunch of helpers to a separate file)

Testing
-------

Using Python 2.7+:

    python -m unittest discover

Using older Python versions:

    python -m unittest tests/suite.py

Code coverage:

    sudo pip install coverage
    coverage run tests/suite.py
    coverage report -m
    coverage html
